2. Review **[Backend Implementation Plan](./02-backend-implementation-plan.md)** for timeline and resource planning
3. Use the success criteria in each document to track progress

### For Developers
1. Read **[Current Implementation Analysis](./01-current-implementation-analysis.md)** to understand the existing codebase
2. Follow **[Backend Implementation Plan](./02-backend-implementation-plan.md)** for implementation order
3. Reference specific feature documents for detailed requirements

### For UI/UX Teams
1. Review all documents to understand backend capabilities
2. Use API endpoint specifications for frontend integration planning
3. Coordinate with backend team on data models and response formats

## Implementation Priority

- **Week 1**: Database schema and core infrastructure
- **Week 2**: OAuth integration (GitHub and Google)
- **Week 3**: Enhanced course/lesson management
- **Week 4**: Basic admin panel backend

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 5-8) - High Priority
- **Week 5**: Enhanced test execution system
- **Week 6**: Discussion system with real-time notifications
- **Week 7**: User profiles and progress tracking
- **Week 8**: Basic achievement system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-12) - Medium Priority
- **Week 9**: Code review system
- **Week 10**: Advanced admin panel features
- **Week 11**: Study groups and collaboration
- **Week 12**: Performance optimization and polish

### Phase 4: Microservices (Weeks 13-16) - Low Priority
