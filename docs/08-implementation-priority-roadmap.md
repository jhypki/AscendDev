## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Items
1. **Basic Test Execution System** (Week 5)
   - **Risk**: Docker integration and basic test execution setup
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on simple test cases first, expand gradually
   - **Fallback**: Use manual test validation if automated testing fails

2. **Code Review System** (Week 9)
   - **Risk**: Complex UI requirements and workflow
   - **Mitigation**: Implement basic version first, enhance later
   - **Fallback**: Simple comment-based review system

3. **Live Coding Collaboration** (Weeks 13-16)
   - **Risk**: Very complex real-time synchronization
   - **Mitigation**: Consider third-party solutions, implement MVP first
   - **Fallback**: Defer to future release

### Dependency Management

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to implementing the AscendDev backend with clear priorities, dependencies, and risk mitigation strategies. The phased approach ensures that critical functionality is delivered first, enabling parallel frontend development and reducing overall project risk.

**Key Recommendations**:
1. **Start with Phase 1 immediately** - these are foundational requirements
2. **Begin frontend development after Week 4** - basic backend will be ready
3. **Consider deferring live collaboration** to a future release if resources are constrained
4. **Maintain focus on core learning features** in Phases 1-2 before adding advanced social features
5. **Implement comprehensive testing** throughout all phases to ensure quality

The roadmap is designed to deliver a fully functional e-learning platform by Week 12, with advanced collaboration features available by Week 16, and comprehensive analytics capabilities by Week 20 if resources permit.
